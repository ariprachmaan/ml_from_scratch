# Logistic Regression from Scratch
## Introduction
Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm known for its simplicity and interpretability. It's widely used for tasks like probability estimation and sample categorization.

## Component of Learning
Cost Function: Measures how well the model predicts actual labels using log loss or cross-entropy loss.
Optimization Objective: Aims to minimize the cost function, finding weights and bias for accurate predictions.
Model Parameters: Weights and bias are adjusted to minimize the cost function, determining feature influence.
Optimization Algorithm: Gradient Descent updates weights and bias iteratively, reducing the cost function to optimize the model.
Prediction: Sigmoid function maps features to probabilities between 0 and 1, aiding in binary predictions.
Implementation and Experiment
We implemented logistic regression from scratch in Python, leveraging concepts like gradient descent and the sigmoid function. Synthetic data was created for testing, and the model was evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1 score.

## Implementation Code
The implementation code involves:

Importing necessary libraries
Creating synthetic data
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Fitting the logistic regression model
Making predictions and calculating probabilities
Computing the confusion matrix and evaluation metrics
Conclusion
By building logistic regression from scratch and experimenting with synthetic data, we gained insights into its mechanics and practical applications. This exploration serves as a valuable learning experience in understanding classification algorithms and their implementations.h
